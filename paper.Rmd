# Introduction

<!-- Purpose/why and what is high-d data (Di)-->

Data commonly arrives with more than two measured variables, which makes it more complicated to plot on a page. With multiple variables, especially if there is some association between variables, this would be called multivariate or high-dimensional data. When the variables are all numeric, or quantitative, visualisation often relies on some form of dimension reduction. This can be done by taking linear projections, for example, principal component analysis [@Hotelling1933-of] or linear discriminant analysis [@Fisher1936]. It is also common to reduce dimension nonlinearly with techniques like multidimensional scaling (MDS) [@Kruskal1964-do] or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) [@Van_der_Maaten2008-qa]. 

The focus of this review will be on linear projections, in particular, as provided by the grand tour [@Asimov1985-xr; @Buja2005-cx]. The reason being that it is not feasible to adequately the very large area of visualising high-dimensions, and there have been numerous developments in tours recently.  An overview of the technique, and new modifications is provided, along with how these techniques can be used in a variety of applications, and to help understand nonlinear dimension reduction results.  

A tour can be considered to be a dynamic graphic, because it shows a smooth sequence of projections over time, ideally with controls that allow stopping, reversing, changing direction, or going forward again. It can be useful to embed a tour into an interactive graphics system, where plots can be queried and elements highlighted (see for e.g. @Swayne2003-cc or @Tierney1991). To create the smooth sequence, a geodesic interpolation is computed between consecutive frames.  It allows the viewer to extrapolate from the low-dimensional to  shapes corresponding to multivariate distribution, and is particularly useful for detecting clusters, outliers and non-linear dependence.
