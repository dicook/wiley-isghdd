# Introduction

- Purpose/why and what is high-d data (Di)
- Original tours (Di)
- Dataviewer, XGobi, GGobi, cranvas (XLispStat, Orca, mmvz) (Di)
- Alternatives (Stuart)

# Tours for high dimensional visualization 

- Bases notation (Sherry)
- Display (Sherry)
- Choosing targets, inc pp indexes (Sherry)
- Geodesic interpolation (Ursula)
- Slices vs projections (Ursula)
- Transformations on projections (Ursula)

# Ways of interacting

- Stop/start/reverse
- Manual (Nick)
- Linked brushing (Earo)
- Spin-and-brush  (Ursula)
    
# Software

- tourr (Di) and spinifex (Nick)
- liminal (Stuart)
- python (Di to follow up with Csaba)

# Application

- Model vis examples eg random forest (from Hadley, removing the blindfold) (Natalia)
- Physics (Ursula)
- Bioinformatics (Stuart)
- High-d shapes/distributions: normal, skewed, outliers, (Di from tutorial notes)
