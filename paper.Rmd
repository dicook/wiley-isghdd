# Introduction

<!-- Purpose/why and what is high-d data (Di)-->

Data commonly arrives with more than two measured variables, which makes it more complicated to plot on a page. With multiple variables, especially if there is some association between variables, this would be called multivariate or high-dimensional data. When the variables are all numeric, or quantitative, visualisation often relies on some form of dimension reduction. This can be done by taking linear projections, for example, principal component analysis [@Hotelling1933-of] or linear discriminant analysis [@Fisher1936]. It is also common to reduce dimension nonlinearly with techniques like multidimensional scaling (MDS) [@Kruskal1964-do] or t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) [@Van_der_Maaten2008-qa]. 

The focus of this review will be on linear projections, in particular, as provided by the grand tour [@Asimov1985-xr; @Buja2005-cx]. The reason being that it is not feasible to adequately the very large area of visualising high-dimensions, and there have been numerous developments in tours recently.  An overview of the technique, and new modifications is provided, along with how these techniques can be used in a variety of applications, and to help understand nonlinear dimension reduction results.  

A tour can be considered to be a dynamic graphic, because it shows a smooth sequence of projections over time, ideally with controls that allow stopping, reversing, changing direction, or going forward again. It can be useful to embed a tour into an interactive graphics system, where plots can be queried and elements highlighted (see for e.g. @Swayne2003-cc or @Tierney1991). To create the smooth sequence, a geodesic interpolation is computed between consecutive frames.  It allows the viewer to extrapolate from the low-dimensional to  shapes corresponding to multivariate distribution, and is particularly useful for detecting clusters, outliers and non-linear dependence. 
While tours are invaluable for assessing the geometry of data, they are by no means the only technique available for visualising structure in high dimensional data. An early technique proposed for assessing pairwise relationships between variables is the scatter plot matrix (SPLOM) [@Tukey1983-fj] <!-- there might be others here(?) -->. In this graphic, the canvas is split into a matrix where each off-diagonal element is a scatter plot of variable pairs, while the diagonal elements are either left blank or represent univariate structure. The SPLOM allows the viewer to assess correlation structure but does not scale to large numbers of variables. 

Similarly, parallel coordinates plots (PCP) can be used to explore correlation and co-linearities in multivariate data [@Inselberg1985-kf]. In PCPs, variables are arranged along the (vertical) horizontal axis with vertical (horizontal) axes drawn representing the range of values for each variable. Points (observations) of the data are represented by drawing lines between each variables axis. If there is positive correlation between two variables the lines will be parallel, while for negative correlation the lines will cross. By placing multiple variables side by side in a PCP higher order structure like clustering or lower dimensional embeddings is revealed, however the ordering of variables is important to reveal these features. <!-- anything else? Andrew's curves etc.? -->

# Tours for high dimensional visualization 

- Bases notation (Sherry)
- Display (Sherry)
- Choosing targets, inc pp indexes (Sherry)
- Geodesic interpolation (Ursula)
- Slices vs projections (Ursula)
- Transformations on projections (Ursula)

# Ways of interacting

- Stop/start/reverse
- Manual (Nick)
- Linked brushing (Earo)
- Spin-and-brush  (Ursula)
    
# Software

- tourr (Di) and spinifex (Nick)
- liminal (Stuart)

The liminal R package uses the tour to explore the quality of non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithms. The interface consists of two side by side views consisting of a scatter plot displaying a reduced form of the data, and an interactive tour. Controls such as play/stop/restart are implemented allowing a user to pause on interesting projections and return them to their R session for further analysis. Linked brushing is implemented on both views - if a users brush on the scatter plot view they can see if and how an algorithm like t-SNE has distorted distances in higher dimensional space, while if they brush on the tour view, the tour is paused and structure like cluster separation can be ascertained.
