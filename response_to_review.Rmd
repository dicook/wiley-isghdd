Thank you for the detailed and helpful reviews. These are the ways that we have changed the article in response to the comments.

# Co-editor

- I am fond of this reference, but perhaps Debby's contains it:

Salch, J.D. and D.W. Scott, (1997),
``Data Exploration with the Density Grand Tour,''
 Statistical Graphics and Computing Newsletter,
ASA, Alexandria, VA, 8: 7-11, April, 1997.

# Reviewer: 1

- Overall, there is nothing wrong in the article, but lots of language issues, problems with references, and a few aspects of tours (including software and references) that have not been explored in detail. Please see the attached markup for details. 
    
- Before submitting the revision, I would encourage one of the senior native English speaking authors to carefully do a final language review of the article. I have marked many language problems, but there may be more.

## Marked up comments

- check your citation settings; I would have expected that clicking on a citation brings you to that reference in the reference list, but this does not seem to be the case here

    - **This might be a problem with the Wiley template**
    
- "means" sounds strange; perhaps "refers to the number of dimensions in ..." ?

    - **Changed**
    
- first introduce "one-dimensional (1D) through to five-dimensional (5D)"; then you can use 1D, ..., 5D

    - **Changed**
    
- perhaps "As the dimension increases, ..."

    - **Changed**
    
- change to  "a 2D cube consists of ..." and "a 3D cube consists of ..."

    - **Changed**

- fig 1: explain how the cube doubles: by connecting the vertexes of the two cubes. can you use 3 colors: two colors for the two original cubes and a third color for the connecting edges of the vertexes; perhaps draw those connectors as dashed lines

- p2 l49: perhaps "seen that as the dimension increases by one, ..."

- p3 l14 just "e.g.," or "see for example"

- p3 l14 mention the underlying software as well (and then cite these references)

- p3 l16 what are geodesic interpolations? explain in 1 or2 sentences and add a reference

- p3 l17 "a multivariate ..." or "distributions"

## Summary

- This work summarizes the state-of-the-art tour methods for visualizing high-dimensional data. The tour works by linearly projecting the set of data points down to low dimensions through a sequence of smoothly changing orthonormal projections. The work summarizes the development, components for the display, interaction modes, software and latest applications of the tour method. Overall, the work is well-written and well-covered.  I would recommend a minor revision to authors sometime to revise the content and text (see recommended revisions).

    - **Thanks for the positive comments**

## Strengths

- The literature is well covered and described, and up to date. There are abundant number of examples with figures which covers a large variety of use cases of the tour method (e.g. kinds of display, structure of measurements in physics, geometric shapes, a tour looking at itself, ...) 

    - **Thanks for the positive comments**

## Recommended Revisions

- I highly appreciate the specification of notations in Section 2.1, but few sections use the notation.  Instead, different tour methods are only described in text. 
I anticipate that the readers would benefit from a highlight of key differences between different tour variants and interactions using the unified notations. For example, (as far as I understand) guided tour finds a sequence of interesting projections $A_i$ by applying projection pursuit optimization on a predefined criteria $c(\cdot)$ of ``interestingness'' of a projection, $argmax_A c(XA)$; local tour rocks back and forth from a particular plane $A$ to randomly chosen targets $A_i$ in a small neighborhood $\{A_j |\; d(A_j, A) < \epsilon \}$; manual tour manipulates the contribution of any variable by editing the corresponding row $A[i]$ in the projection frame $A$, $A[i] \leftarrow A[i] + \Delta[i]$ and re-orthonormalizing the columns.

    - **Done**

- Section 2.2: "A guided tour ... The little tour ... and a local tour ..." --- cite? 

    - **Done, cited as much as is possible. There isn't a good citation for little tour or local tour, so we have referred to the original Dataviewer software.**

- Section 2.3: "contains all the rotation to be between planes, not a particular basis in any plane". It maybe worth mentioning the difference between "interpolating frames" (interpolating projection frame A and B directly, which involves particular bases) vs. "interpolating planes" (between span(A) and span(B) ), and briefly discuss how the motion can be decomposed to motion of planes and within plane spin.

- Section 2.3: "The space of all tour *paths* is a high-dimensional torus..." --- All paths, all k-planes or all orthogonal k-frames? 
From the context it's not clear to me whether the space of all tour paths is a high-D torus. 
Consider giving some contexts/explanations to this statement?

- Section 3: Li et al. 2020 seems to propose a different way to control the projection, via brushing and dragging data points as opposed to moving individual variables in manual tour (what they call ``the data point mode'' direct manipulation). 
Perhaps it is worth mentioning it as a way of manual control in Section 3.
